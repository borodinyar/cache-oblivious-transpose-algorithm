# Cache oblivious matrix transposition algorithm

---

This algorithm transpose matrix uses two different algorithms: naive algorithm and cache oblivious algorithm.

The report in Russian can be found [here](src/Report.pdf)

Below are graphs for comparing the speed of two algorithms on a matrix of size N Ã— N.
